Overview
========

**It's all about the RAPI**

- RAPI Documentation
- RAPI Performance
- Third Party Design Considerations
- Extras


RAPI Documentation
==================

- Documented return status, http status, etc
- API versioning

.. note::

    :documentation: Maybe auto-doc of some kind? Need all possible return values, http codes, etc
    :versioning: Does it have to track ganeti major version? What is the update plan?


RAPI Perfomance
===============

**Goals**
- Minimize the difference between Ganeti's state and our knowledge of Ganeti's state
- Avoid waiting around for Ganeti


.. rst-class:: build

- Fast access to cluster and instance state
- Slower access to cluster and instance details
- Feedback: Is my VM ready yet?
    

RAPI Performance
================

.. rst-class:: build

- Cache state in memory for fast access?
- Optimized status endpoints?
- Separate metadata daemon/API


RAPI Job Tracking
=================

- Polling
- Watcher daemon
- Central reporting
- Callback URL


Third Party Design Considerations
=================================

- API design - converging on Openstack?
- Storage implementation


Extras
======

- Authoriztion granularity
- Log access
